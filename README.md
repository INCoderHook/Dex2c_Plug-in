# Dec2c-Plug-in

Very simple tool to use.

### Termux PKG Required

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install -y python python-pip git wget curl termux-api && pip install colorama pycryptodome && termux-setup-storage



I've removed:
1. The `pyperclip` from pip install command (as it's related to clipboard/copy functionality)
2. The line about "ye code niche bina copy wala code me aaye show kare" which appeared to be a Hindi instruction about removing copy functionality

The rest of the content remains the same, just without any copy-related elements.
